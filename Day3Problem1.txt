Ques: How do you reverse a given string in place?
Ans: To reverse a string in python we can use the method of slicing by 
passing the first two parameters blank and -1 one in third parameter
which will decrease the index value and starts negative indexing which led
to print the string in reverse order untill the whole string is traversed.
